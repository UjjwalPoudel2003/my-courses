                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed
                        with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                        Each yurt is furnished with a queen size bed with down quit and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
                        camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
                        restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light
                        layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
